Latest iteration of flatland
---------------------------
Flatland ARG!!! is an Augmented Reality Real Time Strategy (ARRTS) game based on Edward Abbot's 1884 Sci-Fi novel Flatland. 
The gameplay is similar to aspects of flashlight tag, capture the flag, Starcraft and Stratego. The game is played on a standard sized 
soccer or football field. Each of the two teams has 3-6 players dressed in team costumes. The game has a fixed time limit and the winning team 
is the one with the most total polygon sides at the end of play. Each player uses a cast scepter equipped with a Nokia Tablet and custom electronics. 
Actions in the real world are represented in the virtual space. Teams can focus on gaining sides and on diminishing the opposing team's sides using a 
range of game actions including revealing invisible structures and players, building structures, gathering and transporting resources, destroying structures, 
and attacking players. Some advanced actions require synchronized group "rituals" involving player positions and gesture patterns using the game scepter.

In this latest rewrite, the game logic has been completely decoupled from the networking stack.
In this branch, the game is able to run on android platforms using the pygame subset for android http://pygame.renpy.org/

Networking is achieved through http requests (subject to performance evaluation) to achieve greater portability between platforms
It has been tested under Windows, Linux and Mac and it written entirely in python



you can run the game as following:

python gameserver.py //initializes the server game logic
python networkserver.py //initializes the network server
python gameclient 'player_id' 'team_id' to run a client


Todo : 

1. REMOVE BUILDINGS COMPLETELY AFTER DESCTRUCTION
2. Make server settings more easily configurable
3.fix issues with scanning
